## Mark Dyehouse 101

Mark Dyehouse grew up in rural Michigan and graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a minor in Chinese Studies. During his undergraduate studies, he steadily became more influenced by technology and computer science, delving into hackathons and engineering project courses.

Working on the design and construction of a prototype for an inflatable habitat for multiple organisms on Mars geared toward food production inspired curiosity in Mark regarding robotic solutions for Martian gardening. He fed his curiosity toward robotics with an experimental project for aiming to read lips and classify language based on lip movements, along with a prototype for a soccer-related object perception pipeline for a Nao robot.

After graduating, Mark continued work on refining the Martian habitat with three teammates and presented the resultant design as a poster at the 2016 American Society for Gravitational and Space Research conference. From there, Mark became a software engineer with a focus on big data and intelligent analytics embedded into processing pipelines, first working with consumer products and then with healthcare and telemetry data from robots operating in hospitals and pharmacies.

Inspired by his previous work and considering this new telemetry data pipeline, Mark decided to take a deep dive into robotics and chose to attend Northwestern University's MSR program. He dreams of robots safely navigating new environments and integrating much more deeply in society, bringing people together by supporting accessibility for all. He aims to contribute to this effort by advancing his knowledge in swarm robotics, computer vision, soft robotics here at the MSR program.

### Research interests

* Swarm Robotics
* Soft Robotics (and novel actuators for them)
* Machine learning with regards to robot decision-making

## Work Experience
* Robotics Path Planning Software Engineer at Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company
    - I am working on path planning algorithms, simulations, testing, and other improvements on autonomy controls software for helicopters.
    - Stratford, CT
* Software Engineer (Big Data) at Omnicell
    - I built and maintained telemetry data streaming, processing, and analytics pipeline using Scala, Spark, and Kafka with AWS, Databricks (did some feature design work as well). My team won the company hackathon’s “Most Cross-Functional” Award with a fuzzy text matching system for comparing customer and manufacturer descriptions of medical items using a customized variant of Levenshtein distance allowing for abbreviations leveraging AWS.
    - Pittsburgh, PA
* Software Developer at Management Science Associates, inc.
    - Backend software development working on data ETL process and data warehousing with Spark (Core, GraphX, Streaming, ML), Kafka, and Scala with HBase and ElasticSearch. Also works with Apache Drill for automated reporting off of HBase tables. Recently started working with audit logging in Redshift.
    - Pittsburgh, PA
* Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture
    - Invited to the poster session at American Society of Gravitational and Space Research 2016 Conference in Cleveland, OH to discuss and show the project
    - Designing a skin system allowing for resource distribution, protection, and proper growth of plants in conjunction with other elements in the closed loop system 
    - Pittsburgh, PA
* Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science
    - Worked with Nao robots for RoboCup on image processing for identifying objects, implemented a fast random Hough transform for soccer ball detection, worked on data collection for object perception, and built a simple gui for visual data labeling
    - Pittsburgh, PA
* Technical Intern at Lockheed Martin
    - College student technical specialist; dev-ops and network engineering
    - Gaithersburg, MD
* Research Intern at Carnegie Mellon University
    - Characterized liquid-liquid interfacial isotherm, analyzed microscope image data (excel, matlab)
    - Physics Department, Interfacial Physics Lab
