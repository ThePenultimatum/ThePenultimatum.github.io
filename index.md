I am a roboticist and software engineer with experience in embedded systems, backend engineering, data pipelines, and machine learning. I am inspired by nature and the people around me to change the world through robotics and intelligent systems. In doing so, I hope to break down barriers so that people can better communicate and exist in a space together that we can all call home while exploring beyond our own blue marble of a home as well.
