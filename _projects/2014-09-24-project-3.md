## Overview
Using the hop count method in simulation in C of a system of Kilobots (created by Prof. Michael Rubenstein at Northwestern University), I created a local coordinate system based on the ideas in the paper [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8ea/3f18d2f18a69ad774f1ac7cb34ce573d7067.pdf)

Using the local coordinate system, I then had the robots self-organize their lights depending on their position in the local coordinate system and relative to each other to form the shape of the Northwestern University "N".
