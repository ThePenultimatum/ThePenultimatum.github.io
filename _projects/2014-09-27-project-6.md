## Overview
This is my proposed winter project for the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. I am in the planning and initial stages of work now.

The goal is to build a sensor network capable of creating a local coordinate system using the hop count method and then allow a mobile robot to travel through the coordinate system from an inital location to a goal location.
