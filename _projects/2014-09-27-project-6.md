## Overview
This is my proposed winter project for the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University.

The goal is to build a sensor network which uses ultrasonic sensors to localize a mobile robot. Then, the mobile robot performs a physical version of gradient descent to get to a specified goal location with information taken from the sensor network.

I am using the PIC32 NU32 boards for my microcontrollers along with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors and XBee radio transceiver units.
