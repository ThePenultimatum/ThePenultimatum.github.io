## Overview
I designed and built a small car using laser-cut components controlled with a PIC32 microcontroller using a camera for sensory feedback for line-following.

## Implementation

### Components

* 5 ft<sup>2</sup> Clear acrylic for laser-cutting
* Assorted screws, nuts, washers, spacers
* 10x10 in PCB with PIC32MX270F256D designed for compatibility with components detailed below
* 2 rechargable LI batteries
* 1 camera
* 2 rotary motors
* 1 LCD touchscreen
