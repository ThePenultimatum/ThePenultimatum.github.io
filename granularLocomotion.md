## Overview

The goal of this project is to start from theory and prove out, design, build, and test a robot capable of using impulse-based locomotion on and in granular media. This impulse-based locomotion is similar in concept to a piledriver and utilizes research on the yield stress of granular materials. Whereas other recent research into digging and locomotion in granulat material has focused more on external methods of moving the media in such a way that it is either fluidized or displaced, this project aims to use no external moving parts and rely purely on the impulsed energy from an internal actuator along with potential utilization of buoyant effects in the media.

### Main Idea

### Current and Recent Research

### Feasibility

The technical documents with relevant derivations and theory (in progress) are available for viewing on overleaf at this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/srybycnmcjgs).

### Impact Mechanisms

Given that the desired effect is one surface repeatedly linearly impacting another surface which is the chassis of the robot in the direction of travel, one clear option is a solenoid-based impact mechanism. I could simply use the solenoid actuator to use its plunger to impact the desired surface.
Pros:
Cons:

Another option is utilizing a gearing system with a custom tooth set to store energy in a spring and use the release to impact a surface with either a custom tooth or an attachment to the gear at the end of the system.
Pros:
Cons:

A third option is utilizing a motor to transform rotational motion into linear motion to store energy in a spring. Then, the release can be utilized to impact a surface with a component along the spring's axis of compression.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to my adviser, Dr. Paul Umbanhowar (Northwestern U.), for his insightful discussions and support throughout this project. I also want to thank Dr. Matt Elwin and Bill Hunt (also at Northwestern) for their encouragement and advice along the way. This project would not have been possible without them and the support of the MS in Robotics program at Northwestern.
